title: Reflection on Working in Prototype Machine Shop
---

As a freshman, I switched my major from Mechanical Engineering to Software
Engineering. I was fortunate to have had a job at BYU's Prototype Machine Shop
during my first year and a half, but as I got more into the CS curriculum, I was
offered a position as a Research Assistant in a Lab one of my professors
oversaw. There are a few projects I did working in the Machine Shop that I want
to remember.

### Animal Mouth Separators

BYU does various animal studies on bear and deer movements in the valleys. They
asked us to build them a device for opening the mouth of these animals after
they were tranquilized so that the health of the animal's mouth could be
assessed. We prototyped a solution where two pins connected to two rods would
guide another set of rods up the pins. This could be put into the mouth of the
animal, then squeezed to open it up.



### Fly Cutter Tooling

Made a fly cutter out of some steel stock. Wasn't the hardest material, but the
three screw clamps did a good job holding the tool. Gave great finishes to flat
surfaces I used it on.

### Tow Truck Crane

The campus tow truck has two wheel dollies that you place under the back wheels so
that the car will move even if the back wheels are locked. They sat in the back
of the truck, which took a couple guys to get down. It was an awkward, elbow
smacking process. We made two arm/cranes that held the wheel dollies and mounted
to the bed of the truck.

### Cutting Oil Brush Cup

When turning hardened steels, having a layer of cutting oil helps the finish.
We had three guys in the shop, and we were passing around a little thimble sized
scrap piece that we would use to hold some cutting oil that we could brush onto
the part. We were working on an order that needed a lot of turned parts, and we
were getting tired of stealing the thimble of oil from each other. I drew up
some plans and presented them to my boss.

Having a cone shaped bottom heavy design was important - we had all spilled the
cutting oil thimble on the machines or our toolboxes. It also needed to be able to
hold a brush. My boss gave me the go-ahead and I made four.

To finish I put them in Aluminum Black, which is a chemical that oxidizes the
aluminum.

### Learning How to Weld

I also got to work in the fabrication shop when they needed extra help. They
were nice enough to teach me how to weld, and let me pull parts from the scrap
dumpster. I cut some parts and sanded the paint off the scraps, then made a
campfire grill. I did season it in my oven until it had a black cast iron look,
and it has worked amazingly on campouts.
