title: Personal Website
---

## Launch Date

After a lot of small projects that have led up to this one, I am excited to
finally say I have an internet prescence. After leaving social media, I haven't
had a way to showcase my work or talk about the things I am learning. With the
formality of a personal website, I will hopefully be more restrained from
oversharing. Then what I do feel accomplishment with can go here in the project
gallery. 

## Learned

- Self hosting on a raspberry pi
- React Vite project
- The NPM ecosystem
