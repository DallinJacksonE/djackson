## Launch Date 09/17/25

After a lot of small projects that have led up to this one, I am excited to
finally say I have an internet presence. After leaving social media, I haven't
had a way to showcase my work or talk about the things I am learning. Now it's possible, and it is rewarding having written the solution to a real problem I had with code.


## Learned

- Self hosting on a raspberry pi
- React Vite project
- The NPM ecosystem
