## Making it Real

I was in BYU CS 260, which was an intro to Web Development course. We were given
the assignment to build a simple website that would meet the requirements of the
course. These included custom api calls to the server, having persistent storage
for user data, having a websocket connection between the server and client, and
building the website eventually in React. We started the course learning about
the vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It was a lot to cover, but I wanted to
really feel that when the class ended, I would be able to make a real website
that could be used by someone. I thought of my sister.

My sister is quite the entrepreneur. When she was a younger teenager she started
to crochet baby yoda dolls. These were really popular gifts and she did a good
job of them. My Dad encouraged her to consider selling them if it was worth her
time. She decided to try it out, and that's how Kaylie's Creations was born. She
was selling at local markets and through an instagram page. People were buying a
lot of things from her constantly. What ended up becoming a problem was that
there was a lot of people messaging her on instagram about buying these plushies
but they didn't know what they wanted. Some would ask for specific custom orders
that she would have to track, while others would be indesicive. People really
needed to be able to just look at her stock and order something that she had
already made that matched their needs. This would save Kaylie a lot of time, and
the customer would be able to get their order shipped out sooner since they were
buying from her stock.

I decided to make the project from my class into a real website that she could
use. Starting from zero initial knowledge of Javascript, I put my head down and
started to figure things out. 

## End Results

After four months of learning and spending lots of time in the debugger, I was
able to give Kaylie her site. This site was fully functioning for both the user
and her as the admin. Clients would make an account, be able to add plushies to
a cart, order them, see their order status, and chat with Kaylie in the website.
Kaylie was able to see all of her clients and their active orders. She could set
the order status, keep records of the fulfilled orders, and have the mailing
addresses of her clients on easy access. Other functionality included:


* [x] photos of her new plushies to the shop
* [x] setting products to in stock or out of stock
* [x] working integration with Square pay so clients could pay online
* [x] encrypted user data
* [x] links to her social media and a calendar for the markets she would attend


The store was something I learned a lot from. If I hadn't gone for such a big
goal, I wouldn't have been able to take as much as a deep dive as I did. The
repo of my work is [here](https://github.com/DallinJacksonE/startup260). The
website did run offically for awhile, but my sister came to college and she
isn't able to keep up the plushie business. The website is no longer up, but
here are some photos of it.
