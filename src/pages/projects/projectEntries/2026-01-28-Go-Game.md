## Go (wéiqí)

Go is believed to be the oldest board game still played, dating back to 548 BC. As a kid, I saw a book about Go in my Elementary School library and asked for a board for Christmas. There aren't many people who know how to play Go, so I haven't been able to play too much. Despite that, I really like this game.

Last Sunday I felt excited about Go, and decided to build a Chess.com for Go (this already exists). I hashed up a bit of a backend, using python for a backend for the first time. It was pretty simple, a bit more was abstracted away than writing a server in C or Javascript, but it was nice to have something working quickly.

I spent about an hour on it for a few days this week, and I have a Local Coop version playable for a 9x9 board. I am planning on running it on an old PC and hosting it in production.
