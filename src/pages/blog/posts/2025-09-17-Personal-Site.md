Getting a website up is hard. But I am glad that I was able to. I have wanted to
have a personal website up for some time now. I don't have much online presence
since I am not on any social medias. This way I can share what I am learning and
showcase the projects I have been up to. There has been a lot that I have
learned this summer and I feel ready to step more into the dev world.
