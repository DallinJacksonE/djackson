title: Copper Bolt Action Pen
---

We cleaned out the shop orders so this week has been a bit slower. My boss
introduced me to the Inheritance Machining youtuber and let me work on one of
his builds during the lull. I saw his copper bolt action pen and decided to
choose that. I was wanting to build some fun pens for my family as gifts, so this project was
perfect.

I had a bit of trouble getting the interior dimensions on the tip just right for
the ink cartridge, but the rest of the project followed the online print very
well. The project has some fun technical portions. You first split the copper
stock into the top and bottom half of the pen. You thread one end and tap the
other, then screw them together. Then you can bring it down to size and have a
vanishing thread where you can't even see that the pen is made of two separate
pieces.

The clip was also fun to make. By taking some stainless steel sheet, you can
harden and spring treat it by hitting it with a ballpean hammer. Tapping copper
in such small holes felt a bit gummy, and I was worried I would smear the
material rather than actually get a good cut. Using a mill to guide the tap
helped me avoid that.

This has been one of my favorite projects so far, I really love the shine, and
as it ages it will turn a nice dull brown and green, which will be fun to see.
